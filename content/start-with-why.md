### WHY?

I love to share knowledge, and I like to feel part of something bigger. There are tons of information online about JavaScript and Python, but there is also a lot of noise and outdated information.  I want to collaborate to improve it!

JavaScript in special is growing non-stop, there is a library for everything, and many different ways to do the same thing. With so many options, it's hard to choose one updated and best solution. One of my goals with the blog is clear it, to make our developer life easier with articles and tutorials.

I'll add some Python articles/tutorials also.

### HOW?

I have some goals for this year, some of them that I can share are:

- Write on this blog (yeah!!)
- Speak on a conference about ReactJS and/or Python

Basically, the blog will start the preparation to speak at a conference.

### WHAT?

The topics I'm mainly interested at the moment is:

- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- Python
